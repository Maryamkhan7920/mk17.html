<h1>A public service message on Calcium Awareness </h1>
<p>Calcium is vital for healthy teeth and bones. 
It is also important for the health and functioning of nerves and muscle tissue.
Good sources of calcium include dairy foods like milk, yoghurt and cheese, and some leafy green vegetables and nuts and seeds. 
If you donâ€™t have enough calcium in your diet, you may be at increased risk of developing osteoporosis.</p>
<h2>Too little calcium can weaken bones</h2>
<p>If your dietary intake of calcium is constantly low, your body will eventually remove so much calcium from the skeleton that
your bones will become weak</p>
